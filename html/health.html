                    50% of NJ residents are vulnerable to a multitude of 
                    health risks.
                </h4>

                <h6>
                    How many superfund sites are actually dangerous to my
                    health? Am I <em>really</em> in danger?
                </h6>
                <br>
                <p>
                    According to the EPA, there are <b>1,335 superfund sites</b> 
                    on the National Priorities List, a list of sites that have
                    confirmed toxins, hazardous substances or pollutants in the 
                    United States. Some of these sites do pose a more imminent
                    threat than others, but most of them are actively impacting 
                    the health of real people. A staggering <b>74 of the sites 
                    in the whole country are completely unchecked and contain 
                    uncontrolled toxic waste.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>New Jersey Health Impact</h6>
                <br>
                <p>
                    New Jersey is home to the densest population in the nation, 
                    but it is also the location of the most superfund sites. 
                    In New Jersey <em>alone</em>, there are <b>114 sites</b>. 
                    50% of NJ residents live within a 3-mile radius of a 
                    chemical waste dump, meaning <b>50% of NJ residents are 
                    vulnerable to a multitude of health risks.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Minorities and Impoverished Peoples Health Impact</h6>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Superfund sites affect black and brown, hispanic, 
                    linguistically isolated, impoverished and other minority 
                    communities unproportionally. In fact, the amount of 
                    Superfund sites in or near communities with mostly 
                    ethnic/racial minorities is about 2 times greater than 
                    that of sites in or near white communities. Therefore, 
                    <b>minorities are far more likely to face health risks 
                    associated with toxic waste.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h6>What happens when I am exposed?</h6>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Research shows that proximity to superfund sites increases 
                    risk of cancer, birth defects, lung disease, lead 
                    poisoning, decreased fertility, mercury poisoning, 
                    asthma, and developmental disabilities like ADD and ADHD, 
                    among others. Pregnant women are more likely to give birth 
                    to children with birth defects, and <b>people living near 
                    Superfund sites are 6% more likely to be diagnosed with 
                    cancer.</b> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The effect on children is even more impactful. Children 
                    have more exposure to air, water and ground, based on 
                    their everyday activities and consumption of food and 
                    water. This increases their exposure to toxins, and with 
                    it their likelihood of developing childhood cancers, 
                    decreased cognitive functioning and birth defects. 
                    <b>Additionally, unborn children are 4x more likely to have 
                    heart defects.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are 7.4% more likely to repeat a grade level, and 
                    6.6% more likely to be suspended from school. Children 
                    exposed to toxins are 10% more likely to be diagnosed 
                    with a cognitive disability.
