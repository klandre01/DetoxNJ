                60% of Superfund sites nationally are at risk from climate 
                change effects and over 945 Superfund sites are vulnerable 
                to these effects.
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                These effects include floods, wildfires, hurricanes, sea-level
                rise, and much more, all of which can lead to the release and
                spread of toxic substances or contaminants.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>How does climate change affect the Superfund sites?</h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                New Jersey is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate 
                change, particularly rising sea levels which lead to 
                excessive flooding. The toxic chemicals that are washed into 
                groundwater systems can end up in homes and facilities, 
                affecting everyone’s daily life. Additionally, 700 superfund 
                sites nationally are located in the 100-year floodplains, 
                which are prone to flooding, along with the increasing flood 
                rates contributed by climate change, which in turn accelerates 
                the spread of toxic chemicals. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From the collection of essays and poetries, All We Can Save, 
                edited by Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Katharine Wilkinson, they 
                described climate change as a “‘<b>threat multiplier</b>,’ 
                making existing vulnerabilities and injustices worse” 
                (Johnson and Wilkinson xviii). Many of the dangers Superfund 
                sites pose to humans and the environment are amplified by 
                climate change, spreading the toxic wastes originally 
                contained in the soil into rivers and groundwater systems far 
                beyond a Superfund site.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>What chemicals are being released from the Superfund sites?</h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the Passaic River located in New Jersey, there are numerous 
                types of chemicals dumped by the Diamond Alkali Co. previously. 
                Some of them include Agent Orange (a type of herbicide), 
                pesticides, metals, dioxins such as PCDDs and PCBs, etc. 
                They can cause genetic mutations including cancer, and also 
                causes damages to the immune and reproductive systems.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                234 sites nationally are threatened by wildfires, which can 
                release asbestos ash and other hazards into the atmosphere 
                when burned. Asbestos can cause lung cancer and serious lung 
                diseases such as Asbestosis.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Why are the actions taken now not enough?</h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                A lot of Superfund sites are “capped”, which means a layer 
                of dirt or concrete is used to cover up the toxic waste, 
                instead of properly cleaned by removing the contaminated 
                soil. These caps will likely fail when faced with flooding 
                or other elements of climate change, which will result in 
                the release of toxic materials into groundwater systems to 
                homes, facilities, and rivers or streams. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that 9 
                Superfund sites in NJ threatened by climate change are 
                releasing or would release chemicals damaging to human health. 
                Unfortunately, the EPA rejected much of GAO’s suggestions on 
                protecting these Superfund sites, stating that the normal 
                cleaning routine is currently sufficient to face the effects 
                of climate change.
