                    <b>Superfund sites</b> are chemical dumps full of <b>toxic waste</b> 
                    lying right in the open -- and often right in the middle of
                    communities. These sites have been created mostly by
                    <b>chemical manufacturers</b> who actively fight against 
                    and avoid costs for site cleanup.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even with New Jersey having the <b>densest population</b> in the
                    country, we are also home to the greatest number of Superfund sites.
                    50% of NJ residents live within a <b>3-mile radius</b> of a chemical
                    waste dump, meaning <b>50% of NJ residents are vulnerable to a multitude
                    of health risks.</b>
