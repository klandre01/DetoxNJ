                    "73 million people live within 3 miles of a Superfund site. 
                    This is over 21% of the U.S. population being impacted by 
                    health risks associated with Superfund sites.

                    New Jersey contains <b>115 of 1600 toxic waste 
                    sites</b> identified by the EPA as a priority for 
                    cleanup under the Superfund program, blighting our 
                    communities with cancer, developmental problems, 
                    asthma and other life-altering conditions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Much of New Jerseyâ€™s toxic waste is threatened by 
                    sea-level rise, flooding, and hurricanes, potentially 
                    spreading the toxic pollutants of Superfund sites to 
                    surrounding communities and families.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The goal of the Superfund program is to protect our 
                    environment and lives of our loved ones, but how can 
                    we stop the poisoning when there is no money for cleanup efforts?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Superfund budget has stayed stagnant for years while polluters 
                    resist cleaning their messes with decades of litigation. The EPA 
                    then uses <b>money from taxpayers as a last resort.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Detox NJ works to ensure that underserved communities can see Superfund 
                    sites cleared by advocating for increased allocation of government 
                    resources and attention to what experts call a public health crisis.
